### Testnet Launch Event (1)

![](testnet-1-banner.png)

We have many important things to share with you along with the testnet launch. Please read the following part carefully and patiently.
<!--truncate-->

### **Roles**
**What is a Role?**

Role is a group of marked people in Snails Finance Discord. Usually you will have a chance to get a role in our milestone event. Different role always contains different people. One person can have multi-roles at the same time.

**Why Roles?**

An important vision of Snails Finance is to gather a group of skilled and intellective guys to manage the future of Snails by our DAO. There are many factors to determine how many contributions a person did to the development of Snails. However, we truly appreciate those who stand by us at every significant moment. Roles are meant to preserve glories for you. Roles record the contributions of excellent snails from our communities and from blockchain.

**What Roles Can Do?**

Till now, roles can be used for benefit from these:

*A. Priority in our events such as future NFT sales.*

*B. Weights of voting on DAO proposals.*

**What we will do?**

We will bring about the connection of user’s near wallet with his discord roles.
### **New Role — PIONEAR SNAIL**

Pionear Snails are the main force of our testnet launch event. We will present the PIONEAR SNAIL role to those who participate and complete the “Testnet Interactive” Task. More details on this role will be announced after the[ ](https://snails.fi/news/snails-recent-roadmap-and-airdrop-event)[airdrop event](https://snails.fi/news/Snails-Recent-Roadmap-and-Airdrop-Event).
### **Modification on Airdrop Event**
So far, we receive nearly 20,000 participants on “Join Community” task. The number is much more than expected and this makes us begin to reconsider our airdrop design. If we keep this going, as the total airdrop amount set, each person would get fewer and fewer tokens . So we modified **the following airdrop** structure to newcomers to protect the existing registered participants, as below:

After Nov.23th 2021, 12:00 UTC, there will be **no airdrop** for “Join Community” and “Referral” tasks, which means newcomers only need to experience our testnet to obtain airdrop.

The rules on how we calculate the airdrop for “Testnet interactive” task will **NOT be revealed** until our airdrop event finished.

At last, we remind you of the airdrop event time points below:

*StartTime: 2021.Oct.22 AM 12:00 UTC*
*Lasting: 8 weeks.*
*EndTime: 2021.Dec.17 AM 12:00 UTC*
