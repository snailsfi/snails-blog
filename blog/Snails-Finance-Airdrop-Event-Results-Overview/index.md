**Airdrop Rules & Calculations**

1. The airdrop amount for each user depends on the scores of completed tasks.

   The final airdrop is equal = ***FullAirdropAmounts*** \* ***normalizedTaskScore***

2. Community task. ***FullAirdropAmounts*** are shown in **Table 1**.

   If you both join Snails official telegram and retweet, ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 1.

   If you finish one of them, ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 0.5.

    If you did none of them, ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 0.

   If you submitted to the airdrop google form after UTC 12:00 Nov 23th, ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 0.

3. Referral task.

   ***FullAirdropAmounts*** are shown in **Table 1**.

   You can obtain +1 score if you have +1 referral. The maximum of this score is 8.

   For details see:[ ](https://snails.fi/news/Testnet-Launch-Event-1)[>Testnet-Launch-Event-1<](https://snails.fi/news/Testnet-Launch-Event-1)

   If you submit the airdrop google form after UTC 12:00 Nov 23rd, this score = 0.

   For details see:[ ](https://snails.fi/news/Testnet-Launch-Event-1)[>Testnet-Launch-Event-1<](https://snails.fi/news/Testnet-Launch-Event-1)

4. We see that some people made extra contributions to snails during our testnet period either by huge amounts of referrals of huge number of testnet tests. We have decided to make an extra token reward for the **top 50 users** on referral and testnet tasks. (See extra rewards in **Table 2**)

5. Testnet task. ***FullAirdropAmounts*** are shown in **Table 1**.

   We have 10 core functions in Snails testnet. We recorded the types and function usage counts for each user.

   The types of functions of each user were between 0–10, while function usage counts of each user can be 0-infinite. Considering the ***ActionMultiple*** = ***typesOfFunctionsOfUsage*** \* ***countsOfFunctionsOfUsage***.

   We expect each user operates each function twice. So we set:

   ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 1 when ***ActionMultiple***>=200 and a linear score is applied to calculate **normalizedTaskScore**.

   ***normalizedTaskScore*** = ***ActionMultiple*** / 200 (0 <= ***ActionMultiple*** < 200)

   ***normalizedTaskScore*** = 1 (***ActionMultiple*** > 200)
